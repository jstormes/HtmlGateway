# HtmlGateway
A simple Html Gateway library.

## Usage

  PHP is itself a templating engine.  Rather than reinvent the wheel, I used PHP itself as the templating language and
wrapped it in design patterns I liked.  This package is that design pattern packaged in a nice composer format.

  There are two concepts in this pattern, templates and helpers.  

  A template is nothing more than an arbitrary text file wrapped in a PHP class.  This lets us use PHP interspersed
inside the text.  Templates can be included inside templates allowing the text to be built in blocks.  If this sounds
familiar, it is.  This is basically what PHP does.  As this template is inside a PHP object it has itâ€™s "scope"
set to `$this->`.  It would be very bad practice to use anything outside the scope directly in a template.

  A helper is a class that contains logic that you want to use over and over.  Such logic might include translating
between languages or displaying dates and currencies in a local format.
